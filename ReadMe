This repository is for cross-building prerequired packages.

It can be used to build packages for a new Haiku architecture as well as
for building packages for a incompatible Haiku version of the same
architecture as the host.

In order to be able to build anything, you need a haiku_cross_devel package 
that matches the target architecture you'd like to build packages for. 
You can build that via Haiku's build system like this:

	jam -q haiku_cross_devel.hpkg
